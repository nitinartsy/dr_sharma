            <p>
              Kidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, begins when cells in
              the kidney start to grow out of control. The kidneys are a pair of
              bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist, located behind
              your abdominal organs and on either side of your spine. Their main
              job is to filter waste products from the blood and produce urine.
            </p>

              Types of Kidney Cancer
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are several types of kidney cancer, but the most common ones
              include:
            </p>
            <ul class="article-list mt-1 flex-col gap-0-5">
              <li>
                <strong>Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):</strong> This is the most
                common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 9 out of 10
                kidney cancers. RCC starts in the lining of the very small tubes
                (tubules) in the kidney that filter the blood and make urine.
                <ul class="article-list-sub mt-0-5 flex-col gap-0-5 ms-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Clear Cell RCC:</strong> The most common subtype of
                    RCC, where the cancer cells appear clear or pale when viewed
                    under a microscope.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Papillary RCC:</strong> The second most common
                    subtype, where the cancer cells form small, finger-like
                    projections (papillae).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong
                  >Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) of the Renal
                  Pelvis:</strong
                >
                This type of cancer starts in the renal pelvis, which is the
                part of the kidney where urine collects before flowing into the
                ureter. TCCs are similar to bladder cancers, as they originate
                from the same type of cells (transitional cells) that line the
                bladder and ureters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma):</strong> This is a rare
                type of kidney cancer that primarily affects young children.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              While the exact cause of kidney cancer isn't fully understood,
              several factors can increase your risk:
            </p>
            <ul class="article-list mt-1 flex-col gap-0-5">
              <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Increases the risk of RCC.</li>
              <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Linked to a higher risk of RCC.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</strong> Increases
                the risk of kidney cancer.

              <li>
                <strong>Advanced Kidney Disease/Dialysis:</strong> Patients on
                long-term dialysis are at higher risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Genetics and Family History:</strong> Certain inherited
                conditions and a family history of kidney cancer can increase
                risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Certain Medications & Exposures:</strong> Long-term use
                of some painkillers or exposure to cadmium, asbestos, or
                herbicides.

              Robotic Partial Nephrectomy
            </h3>
            <p>
              A Robotic Partial Nephrectomy, also known as nephron-sparing
              surgery, is a minimally invasive procedure designed to safely
              remove a kidney tumor while saving as much healthy kidney tissue
              as possible. It is performed through small keyhole incisions using
              the advanced robotic surgical system.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-1-5 mb-0-5">
              Why partial instead of removing the whole kidney?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Whenever technically feasible and oncologically safe, saving the
              kidney (Partial Nephrectomy) is always preferred over removing the
              entire kidney (Radical Nephrectomy). Preserving kidney function
              significantly reduces the risk of developing chronic kidney
              disease (CKD) later in life and protects against cardiovascular
              complications.
            </p>

              <li>
                <strong>Less Pain and Scarring:</strong> Avoids the large,
                painful flank incision (15–20 cm) required for open surgery.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Precision:</strong> High-definition 3D vision and

                kidney reconstruction.

              FAQs: Robotic Radical Nephrectomy
            </h3>
            <p>
              A Robotic Radical Nephrectomy is a minimally invasive surgical
              procedure to remove the entire kidney. It is typically performed
              to treat kidney cancer or, less commonly, a severely damaged or
              non-functioning kidney. Unlike "open" surgery, which requires a
              large incision, this procedure is performed through small keyhole
              incisions using the da Vinci surgical system.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-1-5 mb-0-5">
              Can I live a normal life with only one kidney?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Yes, absolutely. Most people with one healthy kidney lead
              completely normal, active lives. The remaining kidney typically
              undergoes "compensatory hypertrophy," meaning it grows slightly
              larger and increases its function to do the work of two kidneys.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-1-5 mb-0-5">
              What are the benefits of Robotic over Open Surgery?
            </h4>
            <ul class="article-list mt-1 flex-col gap-0-5">
              <li>Significantly less pain and blood loss.</li>
              <li>A shorter hospital stay (usually 2–3 days).</li>
              <li>Faster return to normal daily activities and work.</li>
              <li>
                Better cosmetic results (small scars vs. a large flank scar).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-1-5 mb-0-5">Is the surgery painful?</h4>
            <p>
              While some discomfort is expected, robotic surgery is much less
              painful than open surgery. Most patients manage well with oral
              pain relievers for a week or less after leaving the hospital.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-1-5 mb-0-5">
              Do I need chemotherapy or radiation after surgery?
            </h4>
            <p>
              For most kidney cancers (Renal Cell Carcinoma), surgery is the
              only treatment needed if the cancer has not spread. Kidney cancer
              generally does not respond well to traditional chemotherapy or
              radiation. If the cancer is aggressive, your doctor may discuss
              "immunotherapy," but for many patients, removing the kidney is the
              cure.
